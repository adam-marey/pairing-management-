# Cohort Pair Generator

## Overview

Cohort Pair Generator is a smart and user-friendly web application designed to streamline the process of creating random pairs or groups of students within a higher education environment. This application makes it easy to generate optimal academic pairings while considering various constraints, such as specific students not being able to work together. With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, users can also adjust the pairs manually as needed. The generated pairs can be conveniently copied to the clipboard or exported as CSV files for seamless integration into other applications or workflows.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive interface for inputting student names and group sizes
- Customizable pairing constraints for students who cannot work together
- Intelligent random pair generation algorithm that considers constraints
- Manual adjustment of pairs using a drag-and-drop interface
- Export generated pairs as a CSV file for easy data sharing
- Local storage integration to save and load input data and generated pairs
- Responsive design for seamless use on various devices
- Last Creation Tracking: The app keeps a record of the previously generated pairs, allowing mentors and instructors to easily track student pairing history. This ensures that students are consistently rotated and paired with different peers, promoting diverse collaboration and learning experiences

4. Click `Generate Pairs` to create random pairs/groups based on the input data and constraints.
5. If needed, manually adjust the pairs using the `drag-and-drop` interface.
6. Export the generated pairs to a `CSV` file by clicking `Download CSV.`
7. Use the various buttons to `copy pairs`, `clear inputs`, and `toggle` constraints visibility.
