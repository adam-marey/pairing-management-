# pairing management 

- Generate pairs: The app allows users to input a list of names and a room size, and generates pairs of students that are assigned to rooms of the specified size.

- Pair constraints: Users can specify pairs of students that cannot be paired together, and the app ensures that these constraints are not violated in the generated pairs.

- Clear input: A clear input button is provided to allow users to easily clear the input field.

- Toggle constraints: The app provides a button to toggle the visibility of the pair constraints input field.

- Copy output: Users can copy the generated pairs to the clipboard with the click of a button.

- Save and load input and output data: The app saves the input data (names, room size, and pair constraints) and the generated pairs to local storage, and loads them on page load.

- Last generated: The app displays the date and time of the last time the pairs were generated, and allows users to easily see when the pairs were last updated.

- Room size calculation: The app automatically calculates the number of rooms needed based on the number of names and the specified room size.

- Mobile-friendly: The app is optimized for mobile devices, with support for touch events and a responsive layout.

- Shuffle names: The app shuffles the input list of names to ensure that the generated pairs are randomized.

- Check constraints: The app checks if any of the pair constraints are violated in the input list of names before generating the pairs, and alerts the user if any constraints are found.

- Multiple pairings: The app supports generating multiple pairings in a single session, with each pairing saved to local storage.

- Display last generated: The app displays the date and time of the last time the pairs were generated, even after the page is reloaded.
